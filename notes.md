# Notes 

__To all:__ Jot down things as needed related to index analysis

## General Notes
1. oil is landlocked -> oversees tension, wti 
2. will probably use bert to account for these factors 
3. look at supply data, which has better correlation, WTI + DEMAND/SUPPLY OR BRENT + DEMAND/SUPLY
4. Does this impact inflation, control in economy? 
less than 1percent change, return of 10 percent 
5. does this impact inflation? control in economy ? -> sp500 or dowjones
6. Variable Isolation -> which variables 
7. model the specific oils within indexes 
8. oil is landlocked -> oversees tension, wti 
9. will probably use bert to account for these factors 

## Paper Notes 
 - "Panel B of Table 5 displays summary statistics of the macroeconomic variables, which are also matched with 199 event windows of funds needed by the oil-financed clubs in the player transfer market.  Interestingly, the average return of the S&P 500 is about the same as the average oil abnormal return (0.2% versus 0.22%) over these 199 event windows. However, the maximum value of the latter is more than double that of the former (13.95% versus 6.17%). Fluctuations in the USD exchange rate are even less than the S&P 500. Overall, it seems that the factors which are commonly associated with oil price fluctuations are not the main reason for abnormal fluctuations in oil markets over these 199 events windows."
