# Notes 

__To all:__ Jot down things as needed related to index analysis

## General Notes
1. oil is landlocked -> oversees tension, wti 
2. will probably use bert to account for these factors 
3. look at supply data, which has better correlation, WTI + DEMAND/SUPPLY OR BRENT + DEMAND/SUPLY
5. does this impact inflation? control in economy ? -> sp500 or dowjones
6. Variable Isolation -> which variables 
7. model the specific oils within indexes 
8. oil is landlocked -> oversees tension, wti 
9. will probably use bert to account for these factors

## Paper/Reading Notes 

### Research Paper Science Direct
 - "Panel B of Table 5 displays summary statistics of the macroeconomic variables, which are also matched with 199 event windows of funds needed by the oil-financed clubs in the player transfer market.  Interestingly, the average return of the S&P 500 is about the same as the average oil abnormal return (0.2% versus 0.22%) over these 199 event windows. However, the maximum value of the latter is more than double that of the former (13.95% versus 6.17%). Fluctuations in the USD exchange rate are even less than the S&P 500. Overall, it seems that the factors which are commonly associated with oil price fluctuations are not the main reason for abnormal fluctuations in oil markets over these 199 events windows."

 ### Wikipedia WTI
 __https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Texas_Intermediate__
 - "For example, in 2008, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Colombia, and Ecuador based their crude oil selling prices on either the Platts WTI Mnth 1 index or the Platts WTI Mnth 2 index (the assessed prices of transactions with delivery in the next deliverable month or the second deliverable month). Subsequently, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Iraq started using the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) as their price index in 2009, but the ASCI index itself is priced in relation to WTI futures with a differential, which imply those countries still effectively benchmark their crude oil selling prices to WTI" -> What is __ASCI__ and what is it in relation to WTI? 

### WTI Benchmark Study

#### Key factors of pricing Brent: 
- Dated Brent -> "Originally the assessed price of Brent cargos sold on a spot basis but now includes
Ekofisk, Forties and Oseberg."
- Forward Brent -> "The forward paper market for full Brent cargos originally 15-day Brent and later 21-day
Brent and including Ekofisk, Forties and Oseberg."
- Futures Brent -> "Futures contract originally traded on the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) and
later on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)."
- "__UK__ was the largest producer, with
the Brent System making up a significant volume of the UK production. From 1991 onward, __Norway__ became the largest producer, with production from both countries continuing to rise until 1999, when UK production reached its height. __Norwegian__ production peaked in 2001. Since then
despite numerous new field additions, overall North Sea crude production has been in decline."
